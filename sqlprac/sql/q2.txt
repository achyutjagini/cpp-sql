This is an exercise that I'm racking my brains to do.

Can anyone tell me the answer and explain the procedure please?



Employee(id_employee, first name, last name)

Subordinate (subor_id, first name, last name, superior_id_fk)



Which SQL command should be created to satisfy the following question?

Select the first and last names of all employees who have subordinates with the same name.
